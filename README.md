# Effective Level
A combat stats effective level is the boosted stat level together with invisible boosts like prayer boost, stance bonus, a +8 constant and void equipment boost. This plugin aims to display this invisible effective level in the skills tab. The effective level is a component in the max hit formula and accuracy and defence roll calculations, implemented according to Bitterkoekje's empirically derived combat formulas over at https://secure.runescape.com/m=forum/forums?317,318,461,66138854.
